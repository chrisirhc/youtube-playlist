# youtube-playlist

Just a way to have a auto-played YouTube playlist.

I use this mainly to set up my playlists for working out.

The 20 minute kettle bell workout I've been using:

```json
[
  { "videoId": "c0VxUFHdYzs", "startSeconds": 6, "endSeconds": 278 },
  { "videoId": "VCcar3MA07w", "startSeconds": 74 }
]
```
